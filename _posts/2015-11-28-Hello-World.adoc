= Hello World!

HubPress doesn't want to save my Post. Let's see whats wrong here..

The error message isn't particularly helpfull.
"Your post was not saved. See your browser's developer console for the cause of the error."

As I'm not a Web developer I don't know what to do with it. Firebug is installed but there is nothing usefull in the Console.

RTFM does help of course. The manual states
"A = Blog Title is required for saving it successfully."

So putting a '=' in front of my title should solve the first adventure.

yours,
hm
